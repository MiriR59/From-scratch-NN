# Neural network made from scratch

Small neural network framework built from scratch in NumPy. This project aims to help me explore intestines of neural networks, attention mechanism, embeddings and simple NLP. Everything is made for educational purposes.

## Purpose
- Learn implementation of attention and embedding
- Figuring out principles of LM learning processes

## Future work
- Expand current dataset (390 words) to include thousand of words for better representation
- Make support for other than 5-letter words
